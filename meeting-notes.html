    <p><b>MERCER:</b> Alright, good. Now that everyone's here, we can begin.</p>
    <p><b>MERCER:</b> Felix, tell me what the submersible found.</p>
    <p><em>[SHUFFLING OF PAPERS]</em></p>
    <p><b>NARVÁEZ:</b> Uh, well... images from the submersible initially showed a normal deep-sea ecosystem -- shrimp here and there, isopods...</p>
    <p><b>NARVÁEZ:</b> We even got a nice picture of an elephant seal--</p>
    <p><b>MERCER:</b> The seal isn't why we're here.</p>
    <p><b>NARVÁEZ:</b> Right. Elias.</p>
    <p><b>PETROV:</b> The submersible threw up warnings and errors after forty-five minutes of exploration.</p>
    <p><b>PETROV:</b> A huge chunk was missing from it upon retrieval.</p>
    <p><b>NARVÁEZ:</b> Initially, I assumed it might've been a hungry or even curious colossal squid.</p>
    <p><b>PETROV:</b> There were teeth marks, though.</p>
    <p><b>MERCER:</b> Teeth marks?</p>
    <p><b>NARVÁEZ:</b> Which led me to hypothesize it could have bumped into a sperm whale; however, the teeth marks don't match.</p>
    <p><em>[HUM OF FLUORESCENT LIGHTS]</em></p>
    <p><em>[MERCER SIGHS]</em></p>
    <p><em>[SLOW CLICKING OF SHOES AGAINST TILE]</em></p>
    <p><b>MERCER:</b> Was there <em>any</em> photo taken at the time of the incident?</p>
    <p><b>NARVÁEZ:</b> One.</p>
    <p><em>[SHUFFLING OF PAPERS]</em></p>
    <p><em>[PAPER BEING SLID ACROSS TABLE]</em></p>
    <p><em>[FOOTSTEPS STOP]</em></p>
    <p><em>[HUM OF FLUORESCENT LIGHTS]</em></p>
    <p><b>MERCER:</b> What the hell am I looking at?</p>
    <p><b>NARVÁEZ:</b> Maybe... a new species of sperm whale, or some new animal entirely--</p>
    <p><b>PETROV:</b> Whatever it is, it's like it knew <em>exactly</em> where to bite to completely fuck up the internal mechanisms.</p>
    <p><b>MERCER:</b> We'll conduct more research. Figure out exactly what this is.</p>
    <p><b>MERCER:</b> Elias, go ahead and fix the submersible as best you can. If you can't, just let us know. We have, what -- two or three others left?</p>
    <p><b>PETROV:</b> Correct.</p>
    <p><b>MERCER:</b> Felix, we'll circle back with the others on this. Let them know what happened and what the next steps are.</p>
    <p><b>MERCER:</b> ORCA, finish meeting notes.</p>
